        Robotics is the interdisciplinary branch of engineering and science that includes mechanical engineering,
        electrical engineering, computer science, and others. Robotics deals with the design, construction,
        operation, and use of robots,[1] as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and
        information processing.

        These technologies are used to develop machines that can substitute for humans. Robots can be used in any
        situation and for any purpose, but today many are used in dangerous environments (including bomb detection
        and de-activation), manufacturing processes, or where humans cannot survive. Robots can take on any form
        but some are made to resemble humans in appearance. This is said to help in the acceptance of a robot in
        certain replicative behaviors usually performed by people. Such robots attempt to replicate walking,
        lifting, speech, cognition, and basically anything a human can do. Many of today's robots are inspired by
        nature, contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics.

        The concept of creating machines that can operate autonomously dates back to classical times, but research
        into the functionality and potential uses of robots did not grow substantially until the 20th century.
        Throughout history, it has been frequently assumed that robots will one day be able to mimic human
        behavior and manage tasks in a human-like fashion. Today, robotics is a rapidly growing field, as
        technological advances continue; researching, designing, and building new robots serve various practical
        purposes, whether domestically, commercially, or militarily. Many robots are built to do jobs that are
        hazardous to people such as defusing bombs, finding survivors in unstable ruins, and exploring mines and
        shipwrecks. Robotics is also used in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics).
